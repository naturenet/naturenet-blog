<p>The only problem with some of the visualizations is that some of the data doesn’t accurately depict the moving border of the hybrid zone/migration zone/pattern because there are outliers that can skew the image visualized through Tableau. I do not see this as being just a problem with the eBird data but perhaps a problem with citizen science data mining in general: how accurately we can convey information via data visualization depends on how well the data is structured and I think that the way the eBird data (and other data from various citizen science platforms) is structured is not compatible with visualization systems. The goal then when designing citizen science platforms to collect data will be to create a platform which organizes/structures the data in a way such that it is understandable to the average persin and easy to use in conjunction with a specific visualization software (chosen by the website for&nbsp;example). </p>

<p>Need to figure out to convey ‘observation clusters’ to depict a more accurate representation of the&nbsp;data </p>

<p>Here is our pre-liminary data visualization for the hybrid zone between these two chickadee types; it is based off of all fo the observations — the data we have contains observations from 1950 to&nbsp;2004.</p>
